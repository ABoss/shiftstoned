**{% date page.date %}** - [*Cold Hunt*][CH]{target="_blank} comes out today, and Dire Wolf Digital has [redesigned][Card List]{target="_blank} the *Eternal* Draft Packs and Expedition to complement the new set. Our trusty Grenadin have processed the changes into this handy interactive gallery for you! Use the toggles below to switch format views, and to filter cards further.

 [CH]: https://direwolfdigital.com/news/eternal-cold-hunt/
 [Card List]: https://www.direwolfdigital.com/news/draft-packs-card-list/

Some notes:

* The **Expedition** view **does not** include the following sets, which remain in the format in their entirety: *Revelations* (including its promos, from *Javan, the Steel Crest* onward), *Hour of Glass*, and the new set *Cold Hunt* (including its promos).  
It **does** include changes to *Empire of Glass* (previously in the format in full), other Draft Pack updates, and any included pre-*Revelations* promos and older small sets.
* The **Draft Packs** view **only shows Draft Pack changes**, between this new format and the previous format's [September 2021 update][] (ignoring *Cold Hunt's* Draft Preview).  
It also displays card weightings *(the rate a card appears in draft&mdash;for example, cards with a 6x weighting are six times more likely to appear than cards with a 1x weighting at the same rarity)*.
* Switching to the Draft Packs view displays additional filter options: toggles for each weighting, and weighting changes for cards kept in the Draft Pack.
