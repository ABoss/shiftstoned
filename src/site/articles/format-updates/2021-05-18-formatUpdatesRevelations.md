**{% date page.date %}** - [*Revelations*][Rev]{target="_blank} was released today, and Dire Wolf Digital has [redesigned][Card List]{target="_blank} the *Eternal* Draft Packs and Expedition to complement the new set. Our trusty Grenadin have processed the changes into this handy interactive gallery for you! Use the toggles below to switch format views, and to filter cards further.

 [Rev]: https://www.direwolfdigital.com/news/new-set-eternal-revelations/
 [Card List]: https://www.direwolfdigital.com/news/draft-packs-card-list/

A few notes:

* The **Expedition** view **does not** include the following sets, which remain in the format in their entirety: *Empire of Glass* (including its promos, from *Tayana, the Mender* onward), *Buried Memories*, *Stormbreak*, and *Revelations* (including its promos).  
It **does** include changes to *Argent Depths* (previously in the format in full), other Draft Pack updates, pre-*Empire of Glass* promos, and older small sets.
* The **Draft Packs** view **only shows Draft Pack changes**, between this new format and the earlier format's [April 2021 update][] (ignoring *Revelations'* Draft Preview).  
It also displays card weightings *(the rate a card appears in draft&mdash;for example, cards with a 5x weighting are five times more likely to appear than cards with a 1x weighting at the same rarity)*.
* Switching to the Draft Packs view displays additional filter options: toggles for each weighting, and weighting changes for cards kept in the Draft Pack.
